    text: `We went to Colchester Zoo on 27th September for my daughters birthday  and I have to say it was INCREDIBLE! 
    The zoo was beautiful, the animals were in well maintained enclosures. 
    The staff were brilliant! They assisted us with first aid when my daughter got stung by a hornet and the food outlet staff were lovely. I would especially like to mention Zoo host Mo, who spent the majority of time helping us find our way and she even spent time talking to my 7 & 9 year old who loved asking questions. I would also like to mention Zoo keeper, Laura who stopped to talk to us at the Hyena enclosure, who again was amazing! She spent a good 20 minutes talking to my daughters about the hyenas, answering all their questions and was put her answers in ways they could understand. 
    The zoo made my 7 years old day having wolves! She ABSOLUTELY adores wolves and didn’t want to leave. We had to pick up a wolf necklace from the gift shop.
    Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience! 
    Definitely will be back. 100% recommend.`,

    text: `Our first visit  here today for both my hubby and I. What a gem of a place!! So clean and beautifully laid out. The animals seemed so happy in their well thought out enclosures. Such a wide range of animals to see including my favourite the red panda. Informative signs. Our lunch was delicious and good value for money.  All toilets visited were clean. Staff were polite and friendly. It was well worth our two hour journey  to get to you. We will be back. Thank you for a great day out x`,

    text: `Enjoyed a lovely day out for my sons 11th birthday. Lots of places to eat, benches and picnic areas. Lots of animals to see here unfortunately didn’t get chance to see them all. This place is  exhausting! There’s just so many hills to go up some very step and I had a double pushchair. If I knew it was going to be this hilly I honestly wouldn’t of gone I was exhausted.`,
